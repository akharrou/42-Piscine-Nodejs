<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class handles vectors.

The Class’ constructor is waiting for an array. The following keys are required:

	- ’dest’: the vector’s destination vertex, mandatory.

	- ’orig’: the vector’s origin vertex, optional, by default is worth a new instance of
       the x=0, y=0, z=0, w=1 vertex.


The class provides the following methods :

Vector   add( new Vector(rhs) );
Adds each vector constitutive and returns a new Vector instance.

Vector   sub( new Vector(rhs) );
Substracts each vector constitutive and returns a new Vector instance.

Vector   mult( f );
Multiplies each vector constitutive by factor 'f' and returns a new Vector
instance.

float    magnitude();
returns the vector’s length (or "norm").

Vector    normalize();
returns a normalized version of the vector. If the vector is
already normalized, returns a fresh copy of the vector.

Vector    add( Vector $rhs );
returns the sum vector of both vectors.

Vector    sub( Vector $rhs );
returns the difference vector of both vectors.

Vector    opposite();
returns the opposite vector.

Vector    scalarProduct( $k );
returns the multiplication of the vector with a scalar.

float    dotProduct( Vector $rhs );
returns the scalar multiplication of both vectors.

float    cos( Vector $rhs );
returns the angle’sAppendix cosine between both vectors.

Vector    crossProduct( Vector $rhs );
returns the cross multiplication of both vectors (right-hand mark!)
